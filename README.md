#  Resources For Advanced Module Preparation

These resources are to help students prepare for Advanced Modules at AnnieCannons.

It can be helpful for those who are:

- currently taking a pre-Advanced Module course
- ready to jump into an Advanced Module course after a break in their studies

We have put them in one location so that you can feel confident you know _exactly_ what skills are needed to enter the Advanced Modules.

Here's what this repository has for you:

- [Learning Objectives](./learningObjectives.md) for our pre-Advanced Module course, Intro to Programming, so you know in detail the **skill goals** from the preceding course
- [external resources](./resources.md) for those Learning Objectives, so that you can **obtain those skills** you don't currently have
